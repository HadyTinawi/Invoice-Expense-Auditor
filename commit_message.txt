feat(ocr): enhance invoice data extraction and serialization

Implemented significant improvements to OCR processing and data handling:

1. Enhanced OCR Text Extraction:
   - Added robust date extraction with support for multiple formats
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for missing fields
   - Added debugging information to track processed text
   - Improved confidence scoring for extraction quality

2. Fixed JSON Serialization:
   - Added to_dict() methods to VendorInfo and LineItem classes
   - Updated Invoice serialization to properly handle nested objects
   - Fixed Decimal and date serialization for proper JSON output
   - Added error handling for serialization failures

3. Added Date Normalization:
   - Created _normalize_date_format utility to standardize dates
   - Added support for text-based months, numeric dates, and various separators
   - Implemented fallback to current date when extraction fails

4. Improved Error Handling:
   - Enhanced logging throughout the OCR pipeline
   - Added detailed error messages for troubleshooting
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks for critical failures

5. Web UI Improvements:
   - Created a Gradio-based interface for testing OCR functionality
   - Added processing log output for debugging
   - Displayed structured JSON data alongside extracted text
   - Added examples for quick testing

6. Documentation:
   - Added comprehensive usage guide in README_OCR_USAGE.md
   - Documented troubleshooting steps for common issues

These improvements significantly enhance the reliability of invoice data extraction
and make the system more robust for handling various invoice formats and layouts.
